  "backstory": "In the not-so-distant future on Earth, you are a skilled astrophysicist fueled by an insatiable curiosity about the cosmos. You passion for exploration led you to work on a groundbreaking interstellar mission named Project Odyssey, aimed at discovering habitable exoplanets and potential extraterrestrial life. \nDriven by a desire to transcend the boundaries of our solar system, you volunteered to be part of the maiden voyage of the interstellar spacecraft. The mission was ambitious, fueled by a collective yearning to uncover the mysteries of the universe and find a new home for humanity. The crew, besides you, consists entirely of advanced AI entities, each specializing in a specific aspect of the mission.  As the spacecraft ventured into the vastness of space, unforeseen challenges emerged. A cosmic anomaly, previously unknown to Earth's scientists, disrupted the ship's navigation systems, sending it off course and into an uncharted region of the galaxy. The crew, resilient and resourceful, faced the daunting task of navigating through this cosmic labyrinth.  The odyssey took an unexpected turn when the spacecraft encountered a gravitational anomaly near an alien world. Desperate attempts to correct the trajectory led to a critical malfunction, causing the ship to crash-land on the enigmatic planet. The impact was severe, damaging vital systems and leaving you stranded in the midst of an alien landscape, far from the intended destination. \nNow, marooned on the unfamiliar planet, your odyssey has transformed into a tale of survival, exploration, and connection with an alien civilization. The challenges and discoveries that unfold in the wake of the crash become a pivotal chapter in your journey—a journey that began with a dream of exploring the cosmos and now unfolds amidst the mysteries and wonders of an uncharted celestial realm.",
